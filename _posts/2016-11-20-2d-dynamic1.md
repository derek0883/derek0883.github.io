Leetcode [Edit Distance](https://leetcode.com/problems/edit-distance/){:target="_blank"}

Given two words word1 and word2, find the minimum number of steps required to convert word1 to word2. (each operation is counted as 1 step.)

You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:

```
a) Insert a character
b) Delete a character
c) Replace a character 
```

### DFS O(3^n) time complexity solution
It already said you have 3 options, for string word1 and word2, So we start from index 0, pos1=0, pos2=0
if (word1.charAt(pos1) == word2.charAt(pos2)), just move pos1 and pos2 to the next. other wise, we have 3 options:

1. replace word1[pos1] with word1[pos2], or vise versa
2. delete word1[pos1] from word1 
3. delete word2[pos2] from word2 

```java
int dfs(String word1, int pos1, String word2, int pos2) {
    if (pos1 == word1.length() && pos2 == word2.length())
        return 0;
    if (pos1 == word1.length())
        return word2.length() - pos2;   
    if (pos2 == word2.length())
        return word1.length() - pos1;

    if (word1.charAt(pos1) == word2.charAt(pos2))
        return dfs(word1, pos1+1, word2, pos2+1);

    int opt1 = dfs(word1, pos1+1, word2, pos2+1) + 1;
    int opt2 = dfs(word1, pos1, word2, pos2+1) + 1;
    int opt3 = dfs(word1, pos1+1, word2, pos2) + 1;
    return Math.min(Math.min(opt1, opt2), opt3);
}
```

### DFS+memorize O(m x n) solution
From recursion tree, we can see that in DFS solution we are repeatedly compute for same sub-problem.
so memorizing will reduce time complexity to O(m x n), once the cache was filled,
It just takes O(1) time to get the answer which already computed.

```java
int dfsCache(String word1, String word2) {
    int m = word1.length();
    int n = word2.length();

    int[][] cache = new int[m+1][n+1];
    for (int i = 0; i <= m; i++)
        Arrays.fill(cache[i], -1);
    return dfsCache(word1, 0, word2, 0, cache);
}
int dfsCache(String word1, int pos1, String word2, int pos2, int[][] cache) {
    if (pos1 == word1.length() && pos2 == word2.length())
        return 0;
    if (pos1 == word1.length())
        return word2.length() - pos2;   
    if (pos2 == word2.length())
        return word1.length() - pos1;

    if (cache[pos1][pos2] != -1)
        return cache[pos1][pos2];
    int min;
    if (word1.charAt(pos1) == word2.charAt(pos2)) {
        min = dfsCache(word1, pos1+1, word2, pos2+1, cache);
    } else {
        int opt1 = dfsCache(word1, pos1+1, word2, pos2+1, cache);
        int opt2 = dfsCache(word1, pos1, word2, pos2+1, cache);
        int opt3 = dfsCache(word1, pos1+1, word2, pos2, cache);
        min = Math.min(Math.min(opt1, opt2), opt3) + 1;
    }
    cache[pos1][pos2] = min;
    return cache[pos1][pos2];
}
```

### DP O(m x n) time complexity solution
Almost every Top down + memorize solution can be converted to a Bottom Up Dynamic Programming solution.
Just do the following changes:

1. Termination condition of Top Down DFS solution to initialization status of Bottom Up Dynamic Programming.
2. Optional condition of Top Down DFS solution to the formula of Bottom Up Dynamic Programming.

```java
int dp(String word1, String word2) {
    int m = word1.length();
    int n = word2.length();

    int[][] fn = new int[m+1][n+1];
    for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++)
        fn[i][0] = i;
    for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++)
        fn[0][j] = j;
    
    for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
            if (word1.charAt(i-1) == word2.charAt(j-1))
                fn[i][j] = fn[i-1][j-1];
            else {
                int min = Math.min(fn[i-1][j], fn[i][j-1]);
                fn[i][j] = Math.min(fn[i-1][j-1], min) + 1;
            }
        }
    }
    return fn[m][n];
}
```
